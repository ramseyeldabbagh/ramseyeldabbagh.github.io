  								<p>Nadia and Petra are both famous professional tennis players. They are also both members of the Tennis Professionals Society, which is an association dedicated to protecting the interests of professional tennis players, and preserving the integrity of the sport of tennis. In an interview, Nadia says that “corruption in tennis is a big problem, which the Tennis Professionals Society has turned a blind eye to”. “Even the biggest players offer and receive bribes”, she continues, “but no-one ever gets caught.”</p>
  								<p> In a later interview, Petra is asked about Nadia’s statements. Petra replies: “Why doesn’t Nadia name names, if it is such a widespread problem? I’m a big player, and it has never happened to me. She’s just making it up for publicity: it’s easier to get the media’s attention by saying things than by winning tournaments. And, let’s face it, she’s never going to get her picture in the newspapers for her looks”. </p>
  								<p>Sportsworld, a weekly magazine, publishes an account of Nadia and Petra’s statements. Walter, the journalist who writes the story, does not believe that Nadia has invented the corruption allegations in order to gain the media’s attention, but he does not indicate this in his published text, which simply reports what has been said. Sportsworld is sold to the public by a newsagent, Universal Vending. Universal Vending had no idea that Sportsworld contained this article about Nadia and Petra.</p>
